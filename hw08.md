# 问题求解与算法设计/概念解释（Wikipedia）

### 1、阅读 Pseudocode Standard。（答案可以打印）

#### 1）用伪代码描述将十进制转换成16进制的方法

```
set hx, de
repeat
    set de模16的余数 to hx最左边一位数
    set de除16的商 to de
until de等于零
display hx
```

#### 2）C语言实现（先用注释写好算法，然后翻译）

```
int main(void) {
	int de;
	char hx[30] = {0};//声明数组来存放转换后十六进 制数的每一位
	int i = 0, j = 0; 
	scanf("%d", &de);
	do {
		*(hx + i) = de % 16;
		de /= 16;
		i++;
	} while(de != 0);//用循环来将十进制转换成十六进制
	for(j = 0; j < i; j++) {
		if(*(hx + j) > 9) *(hx + j) += 55;
		else *(hx + j) += '0';
	}//用循环来将10、11……等两位数转换成A、B……等字母
	for(j = i-1; j >= 0; j--)
        printf("%c", *(hx + j));//倒序输出
    printf("\n");
	return 0;
}
```

#### 3）使用 -1, 0, 1, 15, 26，3265 最为输入测试你的程序

Input   | Output 
:------:|:--------:
-1      |    \
0       |    0
1       |    1
15      |    F
26      |   1A
3265    |   CC1

### 2、名词解释与对比

#### 1）Top-down design

A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.

Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete. Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. This approach, however, runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought.

op-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top–down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.

#### 2） Work breakdown structure (WBS)

A work-breakdown structure (WBS) in project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK 5) defines the work-breakdown structure "A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."

A work-breakdown structure element may be a product, data, service, or any combination thereof. A WBS also provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and control along with providing guidance for schedule development and control.

WBS is a hierarchical and incremental decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables and work packages. It is a tree structure, which shows a subdivision of effort required to achieve an objective; for example a program, project, and contract. In a project or contract, the WBS is developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, duration, and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, subtasks, and work packages) which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.


Example of work breakdown structure applied in a NASA reporting structure.
The work-breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.

A work breakdown structure permits summing of subordinate costs for tasks, materials, etc., into their successively higher level "parent" tasks, materials, etc. For each element of the work breakdown structure, a description of the task to be performed is generated. This technique (sometimes called a system breakdown structure) is used to define and organize the total scope of a project.

The WBS is organized around the primary products of the project (or planned outcomes) instead of the work needed to produce the products (planned actions). Since the planned outcomes are the desired ends of the project, they form a relatively stable set of categories in which the costs of the planned actions needed to achieve them can be collected. A well-designed WBS makes it easy to assign each project activity to one and only one terminal element of the WBS. In addition to its function in cost accounting, the WBS also helps map requirements from one level of system specification to another, for example a requirements cross reference matrix mapping functional requirements to high level or low level design documents. The WBS may be displayed horizontally in outline form, or vertically as a tree structure (like an organization chart).

The development of the WBS normally occurs at the start of a project and precedes detailed project and task planning.

#### 3）简述管理学 WBS 与 信息学Top-down设计 的异同

同：都将一个复杂的大型主任务逐步细分成许多简单的小型子任务，着重拆分化简，降低执行难度

异：管理学 WBS 强调项目划分的完整性和互斥性，忽视具体执行,一个主项目被划分成很多子项目，子项目独立完成后汇总成主项目；信息学 Top-down 着重功能的细化与实现，主程序的特定功能被分离成子程序，执行时由主程序控制调用子程序实现功能

### 3、仔细观察您洗衣机的运作过程，运用Top-down设计方法和Pseudocode 描述洗衣机控制程序。假设洗衣机可执行的基本操作如下：

#### water_in_switch(open_close) // open 打开上水开关，close关闭

#### water_out_switch(open_close) // open 打开排水开关，close关闭

#### get_water_volume() //返回洗衣机内部水的高度

#### motor_run(direction) // 电机转动。left左转，right右转，stop停

#### time_counter() // 返回当前时间计数，以秒为单位

#### halt(returncode) //停机，success 成功 failure 失败

#### 1）请使用伪代码分解“正常洗衣”程序的大步骤。包括注水、浸泡等

注水

浸泡

洗衣

排水

脱水

停机

#### 2）进一步用基本操作、控制语句（IF、FOR、WHILE等）、变量与表达式，写出每个步骤的伪代码

```
rollerrunning(frequency,time)

set StandardVolume to 标准体积
set StandardSoakTime to 标准浸泡时间
set RunFrequency to 运行频率
set StandardRunTime to 标准运行时间

repeat
    water_in_switch(open)
until (get_water_volume() > StandardVolume)

water_in_switch(close)

repeat
    soaking
until (time_counter() > StandardSoakTime)

rollerrunning(RunFrequency,StandardRunTime)

repeat
    water_out_switch(open)
until (get_water_volume() <= 0)

water_out_switch(close)

rollerrunning(RunFrequency,StandardRunTime)

halt(success)


rollerrunning(frequency,time) {

    for n from 1 to frequency
    repeat
        motor_run(left)
    until (time_counter() > time)
    repeat
        motor_run(right)
    until (time_counter() > time)
    motor_run(stop)
}

```

#### 3）根据你的实践，请分析“正常洗衣”与“快速洗衣”在用户目标和程序上的异同。你认为是否存在改进（创新）空间，简单说明你的改进意见？

同：“正常洗衣”与“快速洗衣”目标用户都为需要清洗衣服的人群，程序都为对衣服进行清洗

异：“正常洗衣”目标用户为时间充裕的人群，程序首要目标是保证衣服清洗的洁净程度，并不着重时间控制；“快速洗衣”目标用户为时间紧迫的人群，程序首要目标是在保证一定洁净程度下，尽可能缩短洗衣时间

我认为存在改进创新的空间，可以缩短衣服浸泡时间，减少注水体积，提高滚筒转速，减少滚筒转动次数来缩短洗衣时间，达到更快速洗衣

#### 4）通过步骤3），提取一些共性功能模块（函数），简化“正常洗衣”程序，使程序变得更利于人类理解和修改维护。例如：

#### wait(time) //等待指定的时间；

#### 注水(volume,timeout) //在指定时间内完成注水，否则停机；

#### 排水(timeout)。 等子程序

```
rollerrunning(frequency,time)
wait(time)
注水(volume,timeout)
排水(timeout)

set StandardVolume to 标准体积
set StandardTime to 标准时间
set StandardSoakTime to 标准浸泡时间
set RunFrequency to 运行频率
set StandardRunTime to 标准运行时间


注水(StandardVolume,StandardTime)

wait(StandardSoakTime)

rollerrunning(RunFrequency,StandardRunTime)

排水(StandardTime)

rollerrunning(RunFrequency,StandardRunTime)

halt(success)


rollerrunning(frequency,time) {

    for n from 1 to frequency
    repeat
        motor_run(left)
    until (time_counter() > time)
    repeat
        motor_run(right)
    until (time_counter() > time)
    motor_run(stop)
}

wait(time) {
    repeat
        soaking
    until (time_counter() > time)
}

注水(volume,timeout) {
    repeat
        water_in_switch(open)
    until (get_water_volume() > volume)

    water_in_switch(close)

    if (time_counter() > timeout) 
        halt(success)
}

排水(timeout) {
    repeat
        water_out_switch(open)
    until (get_water_volume() <= 0)

    water_out_switch(close)

    if (time_counter() > timeout) 
        halt(success)
}

```
